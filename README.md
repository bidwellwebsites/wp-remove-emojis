# wp-remove-emojis

This Wordpress plugin completely disables emoji support, removing extra bloat from your site, helping to decrease load times.

By default, Wordpress automatically converts text such as ":)" to the corresponding emoji character. However, this feature causes extra code to be loaded on the front end, weighing down your pages and causing slower load times. Emojis can still be inserted as normal characters manually without this plugin, making it unneccesary for most websites.

We use this plugin at [Bidwell Websites](https://bidwellwebsites.com/) to help our clients' websites load faster.
